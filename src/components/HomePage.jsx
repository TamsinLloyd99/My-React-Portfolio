                Hi, my name is Tamsin. I am an ex-primary school teacher based
                in London. I've recently made a big career change and am now
                training to become a front-end web-developer. I hope to improve
                my skills and build up this portfolio.
              </p>

              <p>
                My hobbies include cooking and baking , crocheting, pottery and
                looking after all of my 20+ indoor plants ðŸª´. My family are from
                the Orkney Isles and I have been spending my summers there since
                I can remember. It is for this reason that I have grown to love
                all things related to nature and hope to reflect that in my
                work. If you are interested, please check out some of my work
                below!{" "}

              So far I have learnt how to use HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. I hope to
              continue to increase my knowledge and be able to put it to use
              whilst training to become a front-end web developer.
